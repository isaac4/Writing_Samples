#Writing Samples and Copy Edits for Puppet Labs Application

My two writing samples are ["A 'Perfect' Cup of Coffee"][coffee] and ["Bash Config Files"][bash].

The copy edit assignment was to "proof and copy edit" some [problematic text][source]. It wasn't clear to me how much editing was desired. Assuming I had the time, I would want to rewrite this content to make it clearer and more concise. Should I assume that was what was wanted, or should I just fix the spelling, grammar, and run-on sentences?

I decided to do both. Thus there is a [basic edit][basic] and [a more thorough rewrite][update]. I then run GNU wdiff to summarize the [basic edit][diffa] and the [rewrite][diffb].

[coffee]: perfect_coffee.markdown
[bash]: bash_config.markdown
[source]: copy_edit_source.markdown
[basic]: copy_edit_basic.markdown
[update]: copy_edit_update.markdown
[diffa]: wdiff_basic.txt
[diffb]: wdiff_update.txt
