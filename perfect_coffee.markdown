#A "Perfect" Cup of Coffee

With coffee, "perfection" is a pretty subjective thing. Coffee lovers will insist that a good cup can only come from certain kinds of beans, ground a certain way and brewed on a specific device.

This sounds like gastronomic snobbery and there is indeed a certain snob appeal to drinking "the right coffee". But it's also true that there are a lot of small things you can do to make a better cup of coffee. The amount of trouble and expense you go to is up to you.

The following instructions represent the preferences of the author, who likes a mildly bitter cup that drinks well pipping hot with no sweetner or other additions. This brew is easily prepared using reasonably priced beans and an inexpensive filter cone. Other techniques, such as French Press (currently very fashionable) are not considered. Each step presents alternatives that represented various tradeoffs of coffee quality versus expense and effort.

1. **Obtain the beans**. The minimum requirement for coffee beans is that they consist of 100% [Arabica beans][A1]. A lot of inexpensive blends consist primarily of [Robusto beans][R1], with a small perecentage of Arabica added to improve the flavor; these are unacceptable. "Gourmet" brands such as Starbucks and Peets are invariably 100% Arabica, but with mass market and store private brands you need to check the label. 

    Within this requirement, choices are largely a matter of taste. The author prefers a New Seasons private brand called "Cedar Hills Blend" because it's lightly roasted and has an interesting combination of flavors. Many coffee drinkers prefer a medium or dark roast with less nuance.

    Different brands do vary in quality, but unless you have a well-trained palate, the differences are not that important. In times of economic hardwhip, the author has gotten his caffeine jolt from Safeway 100% Arabica French Roast without a sense of undue hardship.

2. **Storage**. Store beans and unused grounds in airtight containers at room temperature. Don't refrigerate or freeze -- coffee absorbs odor easily, so any extension in freshness will be offset by contamination from other foods. If freshness is an issue, buy in small quantities.

3. **Grinding**. This stage is full of cost/work/quality tradoffs. The standard doctrine here is that the best coffee is made from beans ground as needed. Freshly ground beans do make for a better cup (and the smell is certainly pleasant) but require that you invest at least $100 in a quality burr grinder that produces even grounds. You also have to invest the time needed to clean the grinder regularly. Cheaper burr grinders wear out too quickly to be practical. Blade grinders (essentially specialized blenders) do not produce an acceptably even grind. 

    If you do grind your own beans, use the second-finest setting, which is often labelled "drip".

    The alternative to the expense and hassle of grind-as-needed is to use a store grinder or buy the beans pre-ground. This does affect quality, but not unduely so. Buy in small quantitiies.
